sample_pca: >
  PCA is a method to reduce dimentionality and is used to visualise and interpret large datasets by transforming them into fewer variables that contain most of the information of the dataset.
sample_correlation_matrix: > 
  Correlation is a statistical measure which helps
  in measuring the relationship of samples with each other.
  Correlation is computed as a coefficient.
sample_scatter: >
  A scatter plot compares gene expression values
  between two samples and can be used to visualise the 
  overall gene expression trend.
gene_expression: >
  This plot visualizes the bar plots of gene expressions
  for all groups. The bar plots can be used to interpret the
  maximum and minimum values of a statistic along with its quartiles and median.
de_select_design: >
  Use this widget to select groups and run differential analysis
  using DESeq2.
de_plots: >
  <ol>
  <li><b>MA Plot</b>: MA plot visualizes the differences between two groups, the log2 (Fold Change)
  value is on the Y axis and the baseMean is on the X axis. </li> 
  <li><b>Volcano Plot</b>: It is a scatter plot which has -log10(P value) on the Y axis and log2 (Fold Change) on the X axis
  It can be used to interpret statistical significance as compared to magnitude
  of change. </li>
  <li><b>Pie Chart</b>: The summary section displays a pie chart of genes which
  categorises genes in categories such as up regulated, down regulated,
  non differentially expressed, low counts and outlier.
  This gives an overall view of the differential expression. </li>
  </ol>
de_result_table: >
  This table displays results from DESeq2, it can be downloaded as a CSV file using the 
  download button.  
de_heatmap: >
  A heatmap is used for visualizing data wherein the colour indicates the intensity of gene expression.
  This plot can be used to identify over expressed and under expressed genes across a group comparison.

enrich_result: >
  <ol>
  <li><b>Dot Plot</b>: The enrichment dotplot visualizes the significantly
  enriched gene sets. The colour of the dots representing
  the gene sets indicates their significance (p adjusted value), while the 
  size indicates number of genes involved in the gene sets. </li>
  <li><b>Emap Plot</b>: Enrichment map organizes enriched terms into a network with edges connecting overlapping gene sets. 
  In this way, mutually overlapping gene sets are tend to cluster together, making it easy to identify functional modules.  </li>
  <li><b>Cnet Plot</b>: The cnetplot depicts the linkages of genes and biological concepts (e.g. GO terms or KEGG pathways) 
  as a network (helpful to see which genes are involved in enriched pathways and genes that may 
  belong to multiple annotation categories). </li>
  <li><b>Ridge Plot</b>: Grouped by gene set, density plots are generated by using the frequency of fold change values 
  per gene within each set. 
  Helpful to interpret up/down-regulated pathways. </li>
  <li><b>GSEA Plot</b>: Plot of the Running Enrichment Score (green line) for a gene set as the analysis 
  walks down the ranked gene list, including the location of the maximum enrichment score (the red line). 
  The black lines in the Running Enrichment Score show where the members of the gene set appear in the 
  ranked list of genes, indicating the leading edge subset.
  The Ranked list metric shows the value of the ranking metric (log2 fold change) as you move down 
  the list of ranked genes. The ranking metric measures a gene’s correlation with a phenotype. </li>
  </ol>
